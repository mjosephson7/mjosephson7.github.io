                                        <p>
                                            I am a Computer Science student in my final year at Western University, with a minor in Classical Studies. 
                                            I have a strong interest in iOS app development and experience as a full-stack developer. 
                                            My technical skills include Python, Java, Swift, C, HTML, and graphic design, along with 
                                            beginner-level mobile app development. I'm passionate about combining technology with creativity 
                                            and always excited to tackle new projects.
                                        </p>  
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            On the side, you’ll probably find me running, experimenting with new recipes (because cooking should be 
                                            fun, especially in college), hitting the golf course, buying a new hat, or planning my next travel 
                                            adventure. I’m a big believer that food brings people together—whether it’s whipping up a late-night 
                                            snack with friends or perfecting a one-pan pasta that’s equal parts easy and delicious.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            I’m always looking to connect with new people, explore exciting opportunities, and share ideas—especially 
                                            if they involve good food, great company, and a little creativity.
                                        </p>

                                            <p>
                                                A C++ based web browser WebWordle game, inspired by the popular New York Times Wordle Game.
                                                In this game, players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, tiles 
                                                change color to indicate accuracy: green for a correct letter in the right position, yellow 
                                                for a correct letter in the wrong position, and gray for an incorrect letter. Players win by 
                                                guessing the word within six tries; otherwise, the correct word is revealed. WebWordle is accessible 
                                                in any modern web browser.
